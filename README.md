<h1>Interactive rating component</h1>

<h2>What is it ?</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you are asked to create a rating component, going from 1 to 5, and to change the page when submitted. You also have to return the rating score. The plateforme provides us the design we have to replicate, showing the hover and the selected modifications.</p>

<h2>What I did</h2>
<p>Using HTML and CSS first, I tried to copy the look of the component. The main difficulty was to be able to estimate the value of the different size (padding, margin, font-size, etc...).<br>
Then, I did the JavaScript. By clicking on the submit button, the page should change and display the rating score you choose, with a "thank you" message.<br>
In the end, I wanted to do more and to add a "loader" animation before displaying the rating score.</p>
